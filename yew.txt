18.    1. The main components of a PC include the motherboard, CPU, RAM, hard drive, power supply unit, and various expansion cards.

2. A motherboard is the computer's main circuit board that holds the CPU, memory, connectors for storage drives, expansion cards, and connections to computer ports.

3. The CPU, or central processing unit, is located on the motherboard and serves as the computer's "brain." It carries out commands and has components like the arithmetic and logic unit (ALU), control unit, and registers.

4. Processor speed is measured by the number of ticks per second generated by the system clock, called clock speed, often expressed in gigahertz (GHz).

Материнська плата - це тонка плата, на якій розміщуються центральний процесор (CPU), оперативна пам'ять (RAM), роз'єми для жорсткого диска та оптичних приводів, розширювальні карти для управління відео та аудіо, а також з'єднання з портами вашого комп'ютера, такими як USB-порти; це головна друкована плата комп'ютера.

Вентилятор часто використовується в поєднанні з радіатором, щоб підтримувати належну температуру як центрального процесора (CPU), так і радіатора; це називається "радіатор і вентилятор", або HSF.

Чим більше оперативної пам'яті (RAM) у вас є, тим більше завдань може виконувати ваш комп'ютер одночасно; якщо RAM недостатньо, ви можете помітити, що ваш комп'ютер сповільнюється, коли ви відкриваєте кілька програм.

Оскільки ноутбуки розроблені для переносності, існують деякі важливі відмінності між ними та настільними комп'ютерами, наприклад, ноутбук має все-в-одному дизайн, з вбудованим монітором, клавіатурою, сенсорним панеллю (яка замінює мишу), динаміками, а також мікрофоном і веб-камерою.

Більшість виробників мікросхем процесорів тепер пропонують мультиядерні процесори, однокристальні пристрої з двома або більше окремими ядрами, які використовуються у комп'ютерах різного розміру.

RAM is short-term: if you're working on a document or spreadsheet, you need to save the file before turning off the computer to avoid losing information.

If you don't have enough RAM, you'll notice that the computer runs slowly when many programs are open.

The central processing unit is a computer component located on the motherboard, consisting of three main parts: the arithmetic and logic unit, the control unit, and registers.

The central processing unit is sometimes called the "brain" of the computer. It executes commands, so when you press a key or launch a program, you send instructions to the processor.

Bluetooth is a technology for wireless data transmission over short distances. It's often used to connect a keyboard or mouse. If the computer doesn't have this technology, USB adapters are used.

Documents, software, and other files are stored on the hard drive. Information is retained even when you turn off the computer since it's long-term memory.

Every laptop has a battery that allows you to use it without being connected to a power source.

The system clock generator regularly provides electronic pulses that set the operating rhythm for system components. Clock speed is the number of pulses per second.

Before touching computer components, touch a grounded metal object to discharge static electricity; otherwise, you may damage your computer.

You may not need expansion cards, but if you want to improve your computer's performance, you can always add a network, sound, or video card.

In modern multi-core processors, two or more computational cores are located on a single silicon chip. Each core is capable of supporting multiple threads of execution. The use of multi-core processors allows for the acceleration of operating systems and applications that support multithreading.

Typically, the clock frequency of multi-core processors is intentionally reduced. This is done to reduce power consumption while maintaining the necessary performance of the processor. Each core is a full-fledged microprocessor with features characteristic of all modern processors, including the use of a multi-level cache, support for out-of-order execution of code, and vector instructions.

Most modern multi-core processors operate according to the following scheme: If a running application supports multithreading, the processor can execute multiple tasks simultaneously. For example, if a computer uses a 4-core processor with a clock frequency of 1.8 GHz, a program can utilize all four cores simultaneously, resulting in a combined processor frequency of 7.2 GHz. If several programs are running simultaneously, each of them can utilize a portion of the processor's cores, leading to an increase in the computer's overall performance.
